    <p>
      <br>Ello mates, my name is <span class="p-name">Karinne App</span> and I am the human <!--Or alien (^Ì®^)--> that made this good ol' website on the interweb.<br> My github username is karinnenoel; feel free to look at my projects.<br> If you are currently reading this then there are only 4 possible ways you stumbled across my website.<br> One: you are my Computer Science teacher.<br> Two: you are one of my friends or classmates.<br> Three: I told you that I made a website and you didn't believe me.<br> Or four: you are a creepy stalker.<br> Anyway, I guess what I am trying to say is <b>welcome!</b><br> Today you will discover why I like computer science, my accomplishments in computer science,(so far), and my goals.<br>

    <h2 id="2">Reasons I am Interested in Computer Science</h2>
 
    <p>
     The main reason I am interested in computer science is because of my dad.<br> He has always been good with technology,and would use his slight knowlegde to help others.<br> Although,my favorite parts of computer science is different from my dad's the main reason was still because I wnated to share another common interest with him.<br> My favorite part of computer science is writing code tha tmakes up this very website.<br> I have always been curious about the way games, websites, and computer art has been made.
    </p>
   
    <h2 id="3">Accomplishments</h2>
    
    <p>
      I have made many <em>small</em> accomplisments in computer science, but I like to think that they will eventually lead to something greater.<br> The most significant accomplishment in computer science for me was when I taught 5th grade students how to convert to alternate bases.<br> Math is one of my least favorite subjects, so it took me some time to get the conversions down.<br> The fact that I was able to successfully teach them how to convert everyday numbers to binary is my greatest achievement so far.<br> I have coded many little projects on Khan Academy, a few failed games on Scratch, and I have also done a few arduino projects.<br> Like I said before I hope that all of these small victories can lead to something greater.<br>
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="4">Goals</h2>
    
    <p>
     My main goal is to code one website that looks very professional and sophisticated.<br> I would also like to learn how to code a couple of computer games.<br> Theese goals are very small, but it is good to start somewhere.<br> One day, if possible, I would like to make websites for a living.<br> The small details are the best.<br>This website could be a lot better, but seeing as this is a school project I had to focus on getting it done.<br>Hopefully I get a lot better at coding.<br>
